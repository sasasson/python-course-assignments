# Gregorian to Hebrew Date Converter

I used GitHub with CoPilot and GPT-5 mini to generate a Gregorian to Hebrew date converter. My prompts were:

Can you generate a Python function to calculate the Hebrew equivalent of a Gregorian date? I have a csv file with both Hebrew and Gregorian calendar dates, but I want the script to be able to calculate dates beyond the ones included in the file.

Can you make three versions of the hebrew_date.py function? One with user input of a date, one using the command line, and one with a GUI?

I had some trouble trying to get VS Code to test the function, as it could not recognize python and I haven't figured out how to get it to run uv automatically. I ran out of time because Shabbat is starting here soon but I want to try to figure it out again afterwards!
